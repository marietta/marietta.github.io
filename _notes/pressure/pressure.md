Down to 987 and then up to 1020 under a course of a month. Wild.

As a general guideline, nearly all sea-level pressures lie between 950 millibars and 1050 millibars, with most pressure readings falling between 980 and 1040 millibars. Narrowing down the field even further, sea-level pressures often tend to cluster closer to 1013 mb.

A handful of hurricanes and typhoons globally have even had sea-level pressures drop a bit below 900 millibars.  
This is what happened in early October, when hurricane Milton came, which affected the pressure level even over here in Europe.  

In nature, everything is connected.
