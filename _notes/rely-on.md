A few days ago I stopped tracking the pressure, since I've been able to plot it based on historical data.  
And boy it got me confused.  
I felt that I've lost some sense  not only about the weather, but the what-to-wear, the current-ness too.  
So there is need for a system I can rely on, that tracks and shows what I need to know to start the day, go out, be present.

That I can rely on.

We've learned that the most fertile kind of soil is the black or brown forest soil.  
Yet civilized citizens are ought to bare the earth of any life and sow it with some grass monoculture and to maintain a same even looking lawn without ends - because grasses are not 3-5 cm tall.  
They grow up to 60-80 cm.  
The perfect task to keep you occupied and not have energy to ask.

Yeah, jokes on them. If I have to keep doing something over and over, I won't. I can't.  
I'll scream and whatever, but will either find a way to automate, or go to the depths of this rabbit hole on why do I need to keep doing this.. Only to find that I really shouldn't.  
It's bad for you, for the living, for the whole Earth.  
Stop mowing lawn. Stop planting lawn. Turn your lawn into the home of a diverse living ecosystem.  
Where to go further?  
Learn.  
Study permaculture, and build a food forest.
