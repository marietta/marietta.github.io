Looking for woody plants, bushes, trees in central europe that do not have thorns, grow 6 meters tall at maximum, and bears fruit, berries, for the fall/winter animals to eat.  
I've asked LLM's to find me woody plants, bushes, trees in central europe that do _not have thorns_, do _not grow taller than 6 meters_, and bears fruit in the fall, for winter animals to eat. List english or latin names, with a few words about height and how long the berries stay in winter.  
The things they've hallucinated 😱

Here is a list of woody plants, bushes, and trees that meet your criteria for central Europe:

* Borage (Borealis L. ): Borage is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall. It has fluffy flowers that are blue or purple in color and appear in summer. The plant is edible and rich in nutrients, providing a good food source for animals during the winter.
* Apple ( Malus domestica **): Apple trees can grow up to about 6 meters tall and have small, round leaves. They produce edible berries called apples that ripen in autumn and remain viable throughout the winter, providing an important food source for many wildlife species.
* Hazel ( Corylus avellana **): Hazel bushes grow horizontally and can reach lengths of up to 6 meters without branching significantly. They have smooth, golden brown nuts enclosed in a bright yellow hull that animals will be attracted to during the colder months.
* **Rowan** ( Sorbus aucuparia **): Rowan trees are small to medium-sized trees that typically grow to about 6 meters tall. They have sharp, spiky branches and produce red or orange berries (called rowanberries) in autumn that are a favorite food of many wildlife species during winter.
* Brier ( Lonicera spp.*): Brier is an aggressive, invasive climbing plant that can grow into trees. It has thorny stems but produces sweet, edible berries in late summer or early fall. The berries remain viable in winter and are a popular food source for animals.
* Blackberry ( Rubus fruticosus **): Blackberries are common bramble plants that grow vertically and can reach heights of up to 6 meters when supported by structures like fences or trellises. They bear edible, sweet berries in summer that ripen into autumn and persist through winter, providing a good food source for wildlife.
* Balsam apple ( Impatiens balsamina **): This annual herb grows no more than a few inches tall but produces bright red berries in fall that remain viable throughout the winter. The plant is non-thorny and can be easily managed, providing a good food source for small animals.

These plants all offer berry food sources for winter animals while not having thorns or exceeding a height of 6 meters. Remember to always check local regulations and regulations regarding invasive species before introducing any non-native plants into your environment.

#### hermes3:8b 
Here are some woody plants, bushes, and trees found in Central Europe that do not have thorns, grow taller than 6 meters, bear berries in the fall for winter animals to eat:

* **Rowan** (Sorbus aucuparia)
Height: 10-25 meters
Berries stay into early winter
* Bird cherry (Prunus padus)
Height: 10-20 meters
Berries stay into mid-winter

Please note that some of these plants may grow taller than 6 meters in ideal conditions or with proper care. The length of time the berries stay into the winter can vary depending on the severity and duration of winter weather conditions in your specific region within Central Europe.



#### internlm2:7b 
In Central Europe, you may consider several woody plants that meet your criteria of not having thorns, growing no taller than 6 meters, and producing fall berries for winter animals to consume. Here are some suggestions:

* **Rowan** (Sorbus aucupunia)
Height: Can reach up to about 10 meters but will usually remain shorter in open spaces.
Berries: Red or yellow/orange berries appear in the fall and persist into winter, attracting birds like thrushes.
* Hazel (Corylus avellana)
Height: Typically grows between 3 and 6 meters tall but can be pruned shorter.
Berries: Hazelnuts develop on small twigs in the fall and are a crucial food source for many wildlife, including squirrels.
* Holly (Ilex aquifolium)
Height: Usually reaches up to about 10 meters or more but can be maintained at shorter heights.
Berries: The red berries emerge around winter time and remain on the plant until spring; they are not edible for humans.
* Crab Apple (Malus sieversii)
Height: Typically ranges from 3 to 6 meters tall but can be pruned as needed.
Berries: The small, red apples appear in late summer and last through the fall/winter; birds enjoy them immensely during this period.
* **Hawthorn** (Crataegus spp.)
Height: Can grow up to 6 meters but is often maintained at shorter heights.
Berries: The dark red berries develop in late summer and persist through the winter, attracting birds like starlings for food sources during cold months.

When considering these plants, ensure they are well-suited to your local climate (Central Europe has varied climates from maritime areas of northwest Europe with mild winters and wet summers; to more temperate central regions).
Some species may require specific soil conditions, like acidic or alkaline soils.
Pruning techniques can help manage growth height if you prefer shorter plants.
Remember that in using these plants for wildlife feeding during winter, it is essential not to overharvest as this could significantly impact the local fauna’s food supply. 
Always practice sustainable harvesting practices and respect native habitats when possible.
The presence of berries can attract various birds, potentially leading to a noisy environment in some cases.

These plants are well-known for their winter berry production and suitability within the growth constraints you've specified.


#### llama3-chatqa:8b 
* **Rowan** (Sorbus aucuparia) - A deciduous tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall. Its berries are red or orange and last throughout the winter, making them an important food source for birds and other wildlife.
* **Guelder Rose** (Viburnum opulus) - A shrub that grows up to 5 meters tall. It produces clusters of bright red berries that persist through the winter.
* Honeysuckle (Lonicera) - A genus of woody plants that includes both climbing and bushy varieties. Most honeysuckles produce small red or black berries that are an important food source for birds, although not all are suitable for eating by humans.
* Winterberry Holly (Ilex verticillata) - A deciduous holly that grows up to 6 meters tall. It produces clusters of bright red berries that persist through the winter and are a major food source for birds. 

These species produce fruits that can be consumed by wildlife but not necessarily humans, so it would be best if you consulted with local experts or those who have experience identifying edible plants before harvesting any wild edibles.
