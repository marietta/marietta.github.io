When you need a durable sponge with a long enough (years! of) lifetime,  
that is also biodegradable,  
that is also edible (it's a pumpkin/gourd/squash),  
that can be grown in the garden,   
and produces abundance of seeds to be used next year!

    <a href="{{image_url}}"><img alt="{{ page.title }}" src="{{ image_url }}"></a>
    {% endfor %}
