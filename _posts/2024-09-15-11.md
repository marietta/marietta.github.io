title: Atmospheric pressure and weather
---

Atmospheric pressure plays a crucial role in determining weather conditions, with lower values (below ~1000 or 1010 [mbar] or [hPa]) indicating potential for cloudy and rainy weather, while higher values, over 1020 hPa, indicate clearer conditions.

Barometers are particularly effective for short-term weather predictions. A rapid drop in pressure suggests an approaching storm, while a rise in pressure indicates improving weather conditions.

**High pressure** brings fair and calm weather. High pressure tends to suppress cloud formation and precipitation: it acts as a barrier, preventing air from rising and forming clouds, which results in sunny conditions, clearer skies.

**Low pressure** is often associated with stormy weather. This is because low pressure allows air to rise, cool, and condense, forming clouds and leading to rain, storms, or other adverse weather conditions.
